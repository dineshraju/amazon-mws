      # == Optional arguments
      #
      # * <tt>:server</tt> - The server to make requests to. You can use this to specify your bucket in the subdomain,
      # or your own domain's cname if you are using virtual hosted buckets. Defaults to <tt>mws.amazonaws.com</tt>.
      # will be implicitly set to 443, unless specified otherwise. Defaults to false.
      # * <tt>:persistent</tt> - Whether to use a persistent connection to the server. Having this on provides around a two fold 
      # performance increase but for long running processes some firewalls may find the long lived connection suspicious and close the connection.
      # If you run into connection errors, try setting <tt>:persistent</tt> to false. Defaults to false.
